# Minnesota COVID data from the Star Tribune

The Star Tribune has compiled daily data released by the Minnesota Department of Health on the COVID-19 outbreak in Minnesota. The health department generally released updated case information daily at 11 a.m. central time, but the scraper automatically updates these four spreadsheets hourly in case other updates or corrections are made to the site.

MDH releases additional information in a daily media briefing, including the county where deaths occurred, which is compiled manually.

Every effort has been made to keep the data accurate and up to date. However, MDH occasionally revises the location of a case after completing its investigation. In some instances in which a case was moved, the daily count may vary from what MDH originally reported. In other words, it is possible for the daily count for a county to be negative if a case was previously reported and then moved.
